# Kotalin

Kotalin is a **multiplatform** library for Kotlin with some general utilities:

## Common

- More primitive iterators: UByte, UShort, UInt, and ULong
- Peeking iterators (along with primitive peeking iterators for the built-in primitives)

## Javascript

- Easier to use replacement for `addEventListener`
